Dear Mr. Holmes,

I would like to complain about your Hotel Paradise where I stayed last week. 

I arrived on the fifth of May with my family and we were asked to wait an hour as our room was not ready. After we entered the room an unpleasant surprise awaited us, the floor wasn’t vacuumed, the towels were wet, there was no hot water in the shower, the sea view promised turned out to be a view of a brick wall of the adjacent hotel. 

My main complaint however is that I paid extra for a ground floor room since I have young children and didn't want them playing on a balcony, but we got a room on the third floor.

The receptionist Mr. John H. Watson refused to move us to another room even after explaining my situation, he said he was busy and didn’t have time for it.

I request at the very least a full refund of the money I spent for this hotel.

Regards,

James Moriarty
